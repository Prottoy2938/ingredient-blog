> Often when user visits the application they don't have any specific recipe name in mind, but have a overall idea of what he/she wants to cook. In situation like that, a recipe filter feature might come in helpful.

For quite a while I've been working on implementing recipe filter option on this application. The initial version is complete, it supports multiple filter feature as well as filter toggling/removing option.

You can filter your recipes based on:

- **Diet Type** ➡ e.g: Low Fat
- **Cuisine Type** ➡ e.g: British
- **Dish Type** ➡ e.g: Salad
- **Calorie Limit** ➡ max 6000 cal
- **Time Limit** ➡ max 10 hour
- **Immune Supportive** (special)

You can also toggle/remove filters that you don't want:

That's about it. If you found this feature helpful or have any suggestions, you can send **[feedback](ingredient2938@gmail.com)** about it.
