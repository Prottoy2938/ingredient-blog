[Ingredient](http://ingredient.now.sh/) is a web application that helps you find food dishes, recipes, and prepare ingredients.

Currently, it has access to more than 1.7 million different recipes. You can browse through these recipes, find the recipe you want and check which ingredients you need and how to prepare them.

If you don't have any specific recipe name in mind, you can use the recipe filter feature:

You can filter your recipes based on:

- **Diet Type** ➡ e.g: Low Fat
- **Cuisine Type** ➡ e.g: British
- **Dish Type** ➡ e.g: Salad
- **Calorie Limit** ➡ max 6000 cal
- **Time Limit** ➡ max 10 hour
- **Immune Supportive** (special)

You can also toggle/remove filters that you don't want:
