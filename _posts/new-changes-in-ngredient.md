> Over the past couple of weeks, there have been some major changes in the Ingredient application. Some of these changes includes video suggestion, related images,more detailed info on the recipe/dish, and a new blog.

Heres a brief review:

### 1. Detailed Recipe Info

Ingredient now shows much more detailed info about its recipes. These detailed info includes things like the diet, meal, cuisine type, cautions, total calories of the dish. It also has an option to view all the ingredients, health labels, nutrients the dish has and how many people it can serve.

### 2. Related Image suggestion

For each recipe, the application tries to show related images about the dish. So the user can get a better idea of the dish. To do this, the application uses images from _[Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)_ and _[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)_. One important thing to tell is that the image suggestion might not always be related to that specific dish.

### 3. Video Suggestion

Under the recipe-info section, now theres a suggested video feature that might contain helpful details about the dish, what to expect and how to prepare the dish. You can also get more related videos if you want. All these videos are from _[Youtube](https://youtube.com/)_.

### 4. New Blog

Ingredient application now has a _[new blog](https://ingredient-blog.prottoy2938.vercel.app/)_, where we will create blogs about the features, previews, announcements or future plan of the application.

There were also some minor changes like,

- Improved search filter option
- New customized 404 page
- More recipe added to the search suggestions
- _ingredient preparation steps_ has been removed
- New icons, recipe drawer close button position change
