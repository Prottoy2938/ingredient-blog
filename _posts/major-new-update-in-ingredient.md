> Over the past couple of weeks, there have been some major changes in the Ingredient application. Some of these changes includes video suggestion, related images,more detailed info on the recipe/dish, ingredient purchasing option and a new blog.

Heres a brief review:

## Related Image suggestion

For each recipe, the application tries to show related images about the dish. So the user can get a better idea of the dish. To do this, the application uses images from _[Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)_ and _[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)_. One important thing to discuss is that the image suggestion might not always be related to that specific dish.
